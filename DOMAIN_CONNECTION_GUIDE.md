## ‚è∞ Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

- **Time needed:** 15 minutes to 48 hours (usually 2-4 hours)
- **Check progress:** Use [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
- **What happens:** Your domain slowly updates across the internet

---

## üîí Step 5: Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

Once DNS propagates:
- Netlify automatically creates SSL certificate
- Your site will be available at `https://yourdomain.com`
- In Netlify, go to "Domain settings" ‚Üí "HTTPS"
- Enable "Force HTTPS redirect"

---

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Test Everything

1. **Check Your Site**
   - Visit `https://yourdomain.com`
   - Visit `https://www.yourdomain.com`
   - Both should work and show your app

2. **Test Functionality**
   - Try the calculator
   - Test login/signup
   - Check all pages work

3. **Verify SSL**
   - Look for green lock icon in browser
   - Certificate should be valid

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Site Not Found" Error
- **Cause:** DNS hasn't propagated yet
- **Solution:** Wait longer, check dnschecker.org

### "Not Secure" Warning  
- **Cause:** SSL certificate not ready
- **Solution:** Wait 1-2 hours after DNS propagates

### Page Refresh Shows 404
- **Cause:** SPA routing issue
- **Solution:** Check that `netlify.toml` is in your repository root

### Build Failed
- **Common fixes:**
  - Check `package.json` has correct build command
  - Ensure all dependencies are listed
  - Check for TypeScript errors
