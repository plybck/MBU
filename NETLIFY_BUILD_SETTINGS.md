# 🔧 Netlify Build Settings for Music Business Unlocked

## 📋 Exact Settings to Use

Based on your file structure, here are the **exact values** to enter:

### 1. Branch to Deploy
```
main
```
*(Click the dropdown and select "main" - this is your GitHub branch)*

### 2. Base Directory
```
(leave blank)
```
*(Since your App.tsx and package.json are in the root folder)*

### 3. Build Command
```
npm run build
```
*(This will build your React app)*

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Branch to Deploy
1. **Click the dropdown** under "Branch to deploy"
2. **Select "main"** (or "master" if that's your default branch)

### Step 2: Base Directory
1. **Leave this field EMPTY/BLANK**
2. Your files are in the root directory, so no base directory needed

### Step 3: Build Command
1. **Type**: `npm run build`
2. This tells Netlify to run the build script from your package.json

## 🚀 After Entering Settings

1. **Click "Deploy site"** or "Save & Deploy"
2. **Netlify will**:
   - Install your dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Build your app (`npm run build`)
   - Deploy the built files

## 🔍 Your App Structure Analysis

Based on your file structure:
- ✅ **App.tsx** in root → No base directory needed
- ✅ **package.json** in root → Standard React build
- ✅ **netlify.toml** → Additional config already set up
- ✅ **Components/styles** → Everything properly organized

## 📝 Complete Settings Summary

```
Branch to deploy: main
Base directory: (empty)
Build command: npm run build
```

## 🎵 What Happens Next

After deployment:
1. **Your app goes live** at a netlify.app URL
2. **You can then add** your custom domain (musicbusinessunlocked.com)
3. **Your Music Business Unlocked** app will be accessible worldwide!

## 🔧 If Build Fails

If the build fails, check that your `package.json` has:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

Your `netlify.toml` file should handle most configuration automatically.
