# üìÇ Create New GitHub Repository - Step by Step

Follow these exact steps to create a new GitHub repository and deploy your Music Business Unlocked app.

## üéØ Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### 1.1 Go to GitHub
- Open [github.com](https://github.com) in your browser
- Make sure you're logged in

### 1.2 Create New Repository
- Click the **green "New"** button (or go to github.com/new)
- Repository name: `music-business-unlocked`
- Description: `Music Business Unlocked - Royalty Calculator Web Application`
- Set to **Public** (recommended for easier deployment)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license (we already have them)
- Click **"Create repository"**

### 1.3 Copy Repository URL
- After creating, you'll see a page with setup instructions
- Copy the HTTPS URL (looks like: `https://github.com/yourusername/music-business-unlocked.git`)

## üíª Step 2: Upload Your Files

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. **On the new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"**

2. **Drag and drop ALL your files:**
   - Select all files and folders from your project
   - Drag them into the GitHub upload area
   - Wait for upload to complete

3. **Commit the files:**
   - Scroll down to "Commit new files"
   - Commit message: `Initial commit - Music Business Unlocked app`
   - Click **"Commit new files"**

### Option B: Using Git Commands (If you have Git installed)

1. **Open terminal/command prompt in your project folder**

2. **Initialize Git and add files:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Music Business Unlocked app"
   ```

3. **Connect to GitHub and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/music-business-unlocked.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## üöÄ Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

### 3.1 Connect Repository to Netlify
1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - You should already be logged in since you mentioned Netlify is connected

2. **Create New Site**
   - Click **"New site from Git"**
   - Choose **"GitHub"**
   - You might need to authorize Netlify to access your repos again

3. **Select Your Repository**
   - Find `music-business-unlocked` in the list
   - Click on it

4. **Configure Build Settings**
   ```
   Base directory: (leave empty)
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: dist
   ```
   - Click **"Deploy site"**

### 3.2 Wait for Deployment
- Deployment usually takes 2-5 minutes
- Watch the deploy log for any errors
- Once complete, you'll get a URL like `amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`

### 3.3 Test Your Deployed App
- Click the provided URL
- Test that your app loads correctly
- Try navigating between pages
- Test the calculator functionality

## üåê Step 4: Add Your Custom Domain

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to your site settings
   - Click **"Domain settings"**
   - Click **"Add custom domain"**
   - Enter your domain name

2. **Follow DNS Instructions:**
   - Netlify will show you what DNS records to add
   - Update your domain registrar's DNS settings
   - Wait for DNS propagation (15 minutes to 48 hours)

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Everything Works

### Check These Items:
- [ ] Repository created successfully on GitHub
- [ ] All files uploaded correctly
- [ ] Netlify deployment succeeded
- [ ] App loads at temporary Netlify URL
- [ ] Calculator works
- [ ] Login/signup forms work
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Custom domain connected (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate active (green lock icon)

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Build Failed on Netlify
**Problem:** Build command fails
**Solution:** 
- Check that `package.json` has correct build script
- Ensure all dependencies are listed
- Look at build logs for specific errors

### Files Not Uploading to GitHub
**Problem:** Upload gets stuck
**Solution:**
- Try smaller batches of files
- Check file sizes (GitHub has limits)
- Use Git commands instead of web upload

### App Shows Blank Page
**Problem:** App loads but shows white/blank screen
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `App.tsx` has proper default export
- Verify all imports are correct

### Domain Not Working
**Problem:** Custom domain shows error
**Solution:**
- Wait longer for DNS propagation
- Double-check DNS records
- Use [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation
