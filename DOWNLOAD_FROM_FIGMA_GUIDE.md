# 📥 Download Your Files from Figma Make

## 🎯 The Issue
You're looking at your files **inside Figma Make** (the interface you're in right now), but you need to **download them to your computer** before you can upload to GitHub.

## 🚀 Step 1: Export/Download from Figma Make

### Look for Export/Download Button:
In your Figma Make interface, look for:
- **"Export"** button
- **"Download"** button  
- **"Download Project"** button
- **"Export to ZIP"** button
- **Three dots menu (⋯)** with export options

### Common Locations:
- **Top right corner** of the interface
- **File menu** at the top
- **Project settings** or **gear icon**
- **Right-click** in the file tree area

## 🔍 Step 2: What to Look For

The download should give you:
- **ZIP file** containing all your project files
- **Folder** with the complete project structure
- All the files you see in the left panel

## 📁 Step 3: After Download

1. **Extract the ZIP** (if it's a ZIP file)
2. **You should see a folder** with all these files:
   ```
   📁 music-business-unlocked/
   ├── 📄 App.tsx
   ├── 📄 package.json
   ├── 📄 .gitignore
   ├── 📁 components/
   ├── 📁 contexts/
   ├── 📁 styles/
   └── ... all other files
   ```

## 🚀 Step 4: Upload to GitHub

**NOW you can upload to GitHub:**
1. Go to your empty GitHub repository
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Select all files from the downloaded folder
4. Drag and drop into GitHub
5. Commit with message: "Initial commit"

## 🤔 Can't Find Export Button?

### Try These:
1. **Look for a "Publish" or "Deploy" option** - this might export your files
2. **Check the main menu** (hamburger menu ☰)
3. **Right-click on the project name** in the file tree
4. **Look for "Download Source Code"** or similar option
5. **Check if there's a "Share" option** that lets you download

### Alternative: Copy Files Individually
If you can't find export, you might need to:
1. **Click on each file** (like App.tsx)
2. **Copy the code content**
3. **Create new files** on your computer
4. **Paste the content**
5. **Repeat for all files**
