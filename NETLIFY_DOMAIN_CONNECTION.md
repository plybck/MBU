# 🌐 Connect Domain in Netlify (Not Domain Registrar)

## ❌ Wrong Location
The interface you're showing is your **domain registrar's forwarding settings** (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.). This is NOT where you connect your domain for Netlify.

## ✅ Correct Location: Netlify Dashboard

### Step 1: Go to Netlify
1. **Visit**: https://www.netlify.com
2. **Sign in** to your Netlify account
3. **Find your Music Business Unlocked site** in the dashboard

### Step 2: Access Domain Settings
1. **Click on your site** (Music Business Unlocked)
2. **Go to "Site settings"** (usually in the top navigation)
3. **Click "Domain management"** in the left sidebar

OR

1. **Click on your site**
2. **Look for "Domains"** tab or section
3. **Click "Add custom domain"** or "Connect domain"

### Step 3: Add Your Domain
1. **Enter**: `musicbusinessunlocked.com`
2. **Click "Verify"** or "Add domain"
3. **Follow Netlify's instructions** for DNS setup

## 🔧 What Netlify Will Tell You

After adding your domain, Netlify will give you:

### DNS Records to Add:
```
Type: A Record
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: 75.2.60.5

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```

### Or Netlify Nameservers:
```
dns1.p05.nsone.net
dns2.p05.nsone.net
dns3.p05.nsone.net
dns4.p05.nsone.net
```

## 🌐 Then Go to Your Domain Registrar

**AFTER** getting instructions from Netlify:

1. **Go to your domain registrar** (where you bought musicbusinessunlocked.com)
2. **Find DNS settings** (not domain forwarding)
3. **Add the DNS records** Netlify gave you

## 📍 Where to Find Netlify Domain Settings

### Path 1: Through Site Settings
```
Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Settings → Domain Management
```

### Path 2: Direct Domain Tab
```
Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Domains Tab
```

### Path 3: Site Overview
```
Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → (Look for domain section)
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Use

**Don't use the interface you showed** - that's for:
- Domain forwarding/redirecting
- Connecting to other platforms (Wix, WordPress, etc.)
- NOT for connecting to Netlify

## ✅ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. First: Upload Your Code to GitHub
- Create GitHub repository
- Upload all your Music Business Unlocked files

### 2. Second: Connect GitHub to Netlify
- Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
- Deploy your app

### 3. Third: Add Custom Domain in Netlify
- Go to your deployed site in Netlify
- Add musicbusinessunlocked.com as custom domain

### 4. Finally: Update DNS at Registrar
- Use the DNS records Netlify provides
- Update at your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**You're in the wrong place!**

- ✅ **Should be**: Netlify domain settings

**Next steps:**
1. First deploy your app to Netlify
2. Then add custom domain in Netlify
